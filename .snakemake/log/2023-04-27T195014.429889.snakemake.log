MissingOutputException in rule msa_clustalo_ebi in file /home/palby/sag/Snakefile, line 15:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
results/clustalo_COG5002_members_1762
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
